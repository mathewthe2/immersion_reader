# Desktop Keybinds

**Note:** The keys are currently bound to their physical location.  
Explanation from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code):

> For example, the code returned is "KeyQ" for the Q key on a QWERTY layout keyboard, but the same code value also
> represents the ' key on Dvorak keyboards and the A key on AZERTY keyboards.

| Key Code            | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>    | Toggle auto-scroll (continuous mode)     |
| <kbd>a</kbd>        | Increase auto-scroll speed               |
| <kbd>d</kbd>        | Decrease auto-scroll speed               |
| <kbd>b</kbd>        | Create bookmark at your current location |

# Storage Limits

Data like books or bookmarks will be stored locally in your browser storage. Browsers typically apply certain limits on how much a website
can store on your computer. Those limits are different across different browsers and options you may have enabled.

> When the available disk space is filled up, the quota manager will start clearing out data based on an LRU policy — the least recently used origin will be
> deleted first, then the next one, until the browser is no longer over the limit.

Therefore your data can be lost based on the amount you stored and how much storage is available. In order to overcome this limitation ttu reader
will try to request for persistant storage during data insertion. Based on your browser you will
see different behavior. E. g. firefox will ask you for your confirmation while chrome will not display any dialog but automatically grant the permissions if you frequently interacted with / bookmarked the page and / or have granted notification permissions to the site.
You can see the current status of persistant storage in the reader settings.

**Note**: Other browsers may have additional criteria for data eviction which are not affected by this setting. E. g. iOS > 13.3 may delete all your page data if you haven't interacted with the reader for 7 days etc.

# Self Host

If for some reason you want to host the reader by yourself, you can use the following approach.

### Using Docker

1. Install and launch [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run the commands below

```sh
docker build -t ebook-reader -f apps/web/Dockerfile .
docker run --name ebook-reader -d -p 8080:80 ebook-reader
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to use the app

### Using Docker Compose

1. Install and launch [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Run the command below

```sh
docker-compose up
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to use the app

### Using HTTP Hosting App

1. Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed
2. Run the commands below

```sh
cd apps/web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
```

3. Have your server (such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) point towards `apps/web/build`
